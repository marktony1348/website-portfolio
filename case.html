      <h1>Case Study for <span class="myflix-style">myFlix</span> full-stack web development project</h1>
      <div class="intro">
        <div class="intro-content">
          <h2><span class="heading-style">Overview</span></h2>
          <p><span class="myflix-style">myFlix</span> is a web app, developed using the MERN stack, that provides users 
            with access to information about movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to create an account, 
            update their personal data, and create a list of favourite movies.</p>
          <br />
          <h2><span class="heading-style">Purpose & Context</span></h2>
          <p><span class="myflix-style">myFlix</span> was a personal project I built as part of my web development course 
            at CareerFoundry, Berlin, Germany to demonstrate my mastery of full-stack web development using frame works 
            like React and AngularJS.</p>
          <br />
          <h2><span class="heading-style">Objective</span></h2>
          <p>The aim of the project was to have an ambitious full-stack project I can add to my professional portfolio. 
            Also to build the complete server-side and client-side for the application from scratch.
            This aim technically represents the problem to be solved</p>

      <h3><span class="heading-style">Server-Side</span></h3>
      <div class="server-side">
        <div class="server-content">
          <p>This is a RESTful API created using Node.js and Express, that interacts with a non-relational database (MongoDB). 
            The API can be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET or POST. To retrieve data from and store data 
            in the database, CRUD methods are used. The API provides movie information in JSON format.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>To test the API, I used Postman. I also included user authentication and authorization code 
            in the form of basic HTTP authentication and JWT authentication.</p>

          <h3><span class="heading-style">Client-Side</span></h3>
          <p>It is a single-page, responsive application, developed with React and React-Redux.
            After completing the API, I started to build the interface users would need when making requests to, 
            and receiving responses from, the server-side.  
            It provides several interface views, including, but not limited to, a main view (shows a list of all movies), 
            single movie view (shows data about a single movie and allows users to add the movie to their list of favorites), 
            a login view, a registration view and a profile view (where users can update their user data and list of favorites).</p>

      <div class="challenges">
        <h2><span class="heading-style">Challenges</span></h2>
        <p>I particularly found AngularJS framework interesting. Despite that the development process was a bit arduous interesting,
           because i noticed some differences in syntax as ascribed to the TypeScript language 
           of Angular framework. This syntax was then simplified better to me, through the help of my tutor and mentor.
           <br>The most memorable side of the project is that, I quickly became familiar with using the terminal because of the 
           frequent troubleshooting and installations.
           <br>Eventually, the help provided by the Tutor and mentor made the difference and I must say that the frequent troubleshooting
            was an advantage in terms of learning</p>

      <div class="duration">
        <h2><span class="heading-style">Duration</span></h2>
        <p>The development of the client-side was particularly challenging. It took me a month to accomplish the objectives. 
          Eventually, after some break and a restudy of the React documentation, a better understanding was achieved 
          as to the functionalities of React and React-redux.</p>
